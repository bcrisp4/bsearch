# Changelog

All notable changes to bsearch are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

How to maintain this file is documented in [docs/changelog.md](docs/changelog.md):
every behaviour-changing PR adds an entry under `[Unreleased]`; at release time
that section is renamed to the new version and becomes the GitHub Release notes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The index now lives in one SQLite database at
  `~/Library/Application Support/bsearch/bsearch.db` (created 0600, directory
  0700): document catalog, chunks, pyramid-summary slots, and semantic-search
  vectors (sqlite-vec), with production pragmas (WAL, foreign keys, busy
  timeout) applied on every connection. The schema is versioned, so future
  upgrades migrate in place instead of forcing a re-index.

- bsearch reads its configuration from `~/.config/bsearch/config.toml`
  (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/bsearch/config.toml`): indexed paths, inference and
  converter endpoints, and power-aware indexing intervals, with sensible
  defaults when no file exists. Unknown or invalid keys fail loudly instead
  of silently falling back to defaults. A built-in privacy deny-list
  (`~/.ssh`, `~/Library`, VCS internals, key/secret file patterns, …) is
  always active; `[paths].exclude` extends it.
